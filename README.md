Practicing building/changing a new repo
So, this is a new repo that I've created. Let's have a mess around with it to practice using some basic features of GitHub<br/>
I've already forgotten how to create a new branch. Ah, no. it's the option just above the 'commit changes' button. <br/><br/>
My to-do list in GitHub:    <br/><br/>
- Be able to save my html & css files here from my codepens/jsfiddles or even use an editor like vscode to do this. 
- revert back to previous versions of said code
- skip forward to 'future' versions and then back to 'past' versions of the code
- practice adding branches, merging, finding out what rebasing etc is
- maybe ask someone on GitHub to add something to my code, just as a collaborative exercise
- stay away from Gitbash for now as it seems kind of confusing...for now    <br/><br/>

So, do I need to create a new branch everytime I add/edit an existing branch or does it just save/commit as a new version of said existing branch? 
<br/><br/>

Ah, I see. I can choose to save it to the existing branch or create a new branch.   <br/>
Also, it seems that a 'pull request' isn't necessary when creating a new branch or even editing an old branch.   <br/><br/>

I think a 'pull request' postulates the changes made to another person and they are expected to 'review' these changes or just be informed of them. I'm not sure if 'review' is the correct word here as it may mean something else in the GitHub associated jargon. Not really sure yet.   <br/><br/>


OK, so I will 'commit' this branch, create a 'pull request' for this branch, 'merge' this to the 'main' branch and then try to 'revert' back to the original 'main' branch. Let's see if that's all possible.
